His subsequent releases Saawariya (2007) and Guzaarish (2010) were box-office flops. The latter film marked his debut as a music composer.

<h1 id="a">Early and personal life</h1><hr>
<p>
Bhansali was born on 24 February 1963 in Bhuleshwar, South Bombay into a Gujarati-Jain family.<sup>[8][9]</sup> His father, Navin, was a film producer, but due to financial setbacks, he turned to alcoholism. As a result, his mother, Leela, sewed clothes to make ends meet<sup>[10]</sup> and Navin died of cirrhosis.<sup>[11] </sup>Bhansali adopted his mother's name as his middle name instead of his father's.<sup>[12]</sup> He has paid tribute to his father in many of his films. In Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (1999), Sameer's tendency of speaking to his deceased father while looking at the sky is believed to be inspired by a similar habit that Bhansali had during his childhood.<sup>[13]</sup> His alcoholism inspried Devdas (2002),<sup>[14]</sup> including the funeral scene.<sup>[1]</sup> In Gangubai Kathiawadi (2022), a poster of his father's film, Jahazi Lutera (1957), can be seen in the background.<Sup>[15]</Sup> Bhansali studied editing at Film and Television Institute of India.[16] His sister, Bela Bhansali Segal, has directed Shirin Farhad Ki Toh Nikal Padi (2012), for which he wrote the script, while Bela's daughter, Sharmin Segal, made her debut as an actress under his production Malaal (2019), for which he also served as fellow writer and composer. Bhansali speaks Gujarati at home and loves Gujarati food, music, literature and architecture.<sup>[8][9]</sup> He is trained in Odissi.<sup>[16][17]</sup> Bhansali is a devotee of the Hindu deity Ganesha, and has a temple dedicated to him at his home.<sup>[18]</sup> He is also a devotee of the Hindu deity Krishna, and has a temple dedicated to him at his home.<sup>[19]</sup> Bhansali is known for his perfectionism and attention to detail, which has led to both praise and criticism from actors and crew members.<sup>[20]</sup> He is also known for his reclusive nature, rarely giving interviews or making public appearances.<sup>[21]</sup> 
Bhansali has been in a relationship with actress Aditi Rao Hydari since 2018, and they have collaborated on several projects,

He has a sister named Bela Bhansali Segal, who is also involved in the film industry as an editor.<sup>[8]</sup> Bhansali's interest in filmmaking began at an early age, and he pursued his passion by studying at the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) in Pune.<sup>[9]</sup> After completing his education, he worked as an assistant director on several films, including Vidhu Vinod Chopra's "Parinda" (1989) and "1942: A Love Story" (1994).<sup>[10]</sup>
In 1995, Bhansali made his directorial debut with the film "Khamoshi: The Musical," which received critical acclaim but was not a commercial success.<sup>[11]</sup> Despite this, Bhansali's unique storytelling style and visual aesthetics caught the attention of audiences and critics alike.

</p><br>

<h1 id="c">Early work and success (1989–2005)</h1><hr>
<p>Bhansali began his career as an assistant to Vidhu Vinod Chopra and was involved in the making of Parinda (1989) as an assistant director, 1942: A Love Story (1994) as a writer and assistant choreographer and Kareeb (1998). However, they had a falling-out when Bhansali refused to direct Kareeb. In 1996, he made his directorial debut with Khamoshi: The Musical, the commercially unsuccessful but critically acclaimed film about a daughter's struggle to communicate with her deaf-mute parents.<sup>[18]</sup> The film earned 5 Filmfare Awards, including the Filmfare Award for Best Film (Critics).

He rose to prominence in Indian cinema with the musical love triangle Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (1999), starring Aishwarya Rai, Salman Khan, and Ajay Devgn, which established his individualistic stamp for visual splendour and creating auras of celebration and festivity.

<br>


    <h1 id="f">Established filmmaker (2013–present)</h1><hr>
<p>
In 2013, Bhansali directed the tragic romance Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela, an adaptation of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, starring Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh. Some religious groups opposed the film claiming that the former title Ramleela was misleading, because the movie had nothing to do with Ramlila, the traditional enactment of the life and story of Hindu deity, Lord Rama. The film's release had been stayed by Delhi High Court due to the controversy over its title, claiming that the movie hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus. Later the film's title was changed to Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela, and eventually released in India as scheduled. However, after a week of release, Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court banned the movie's release in Uttar Pradesh.<sup>[34]</sup> Despite the controversy and limited release, the film opened to critical acclaim and strong box office collections worldwide, ultimately earning ₹2.02 billion (US$31 million) and emerging as the fifth highest-grossing film of 2013. The film garnered several award nominations for Bhansali including Best Film and Best Director nominations at Filmfare. The same year, Bhansali debuted in television with the show Saraswatichandra, starring Gautam Rode and Jennifer Winget, which he later left after few episodes.<br>

The following year, he produced the biographical sports film Mary Kom starring Priyanka Chopra, which premiered at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival, becoming the first Hindi film to be screened on the opening night of the festival. The film became both a critical and commercial success and received various accolades including a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Film. At the 62nd National Film Awards, Bhansali received another National Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment for the film. In 2015, he produced the action drama Gabbar Is Back starring Akshay Kumar, which also emerged as a commercial success and received positive reviews from critics.<br>

Bhansali's next directorial venture was his dream project, the period romantic drama Bajirao Mastani (2015), based on the love story between Peshwa Baji Rao I and his second wife Mastani. Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone played the title roles, while Priyanka Chopra played Bajirao's first wife, Kashibai. The film was announced in 2003 and was constantly in the news regarding the cast, including actors such as Salman Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Kareena Kapoor and Rani Mukerji.<sup>[35]</sup> The descendants of Bajirao I and Mastani expressed their disapproval of this film, claiming excessive creative liberty by Bhansali causing wrongful portrayal of their ancestors.<sup>[36]</sup> A petition was filed in Bombay High Court seeking a stay on the film, but the High Court refused to interfere with its release.<sup>[37]</sup> It received widespread critical acclaim worldwide and was listed among the best films of 2015 by several sources.<sup>[38][39][40]</sup> Despite the controversy, the film emerged as one of the highest-grossing Indian films of all time.<sup>[41]</sup> The film received numerous accolades at various award ceremonies in India. At the 63rd National Film Awards, Bajirao Mastani won 7 awards and Bhansali won the National Award for Best Director, in addition to winning Best Film and Best Director at Filmfare.<sup>[42]</sup> The film was featured at the 2016 Indian Panorama section of the International Film Festival of India. Bajirao Mastani was selected as India's official entry for the Best Foreign Language Film for the 74th Golden Globe Awards.<sup>[43]</sup> The following year, he produced the Marathi film Laal Ishq.

The film stars Deepika Padukone in the title role as Rani Padmini, alongside Shahid Kapoor and Ranveer Singh in the title roles of Rawal Ratan Singh and Alauddin Khalji respectively. During the shooting of the film in January 2017 in Jaipur, the members of Shri Rajput Karni Sena protested at the sets at Jaigarh Fort, physically attacked Bhansali and his crew members, alleging that he misrepresented historical facts and depicted them erroneously in the film, and also tried to vandalise the sets.<sup>[45][46][44]</sup> On 6 March 2017, members of Shri Rajput Karni Sena vandalised the Chittor Fort again and broke the mirrors installed in the palace of Rani Padmini.<sup>[47]</sup> On 15 March 2017, a group of unidentified vandals again attacked and set fire to the sets of this movie in Kolhapur which led to the production set, costumes and jewelleries being burnt.<sup>[48]</sup> The film earned Rs. 1.43 billion rupees in the first six days after its release.<sup>[49]</sup> Padmaavat emerged as the highest-grossing film of the year, and received widespread critical acclaim, and earned Bhansali the National Film Award for Best Music Direction and the Filmfare Award for Best Music Director, in addition to Best Film and Best Director nominations at Filmfare.
